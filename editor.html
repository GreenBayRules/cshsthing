                          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                          <p>Your task is to create a program that must do/have the following:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>use several effectively integrated mathematical and logical concepts from the language you are using,</li>
                                  <li>implement an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms,</li>
                                  <li>and lastly use abstractions to manage the complexity of your program.</li>
                              </ul>
                              Then, you will write a reflection on your code.
                          </p>
    
                          <h3>Tips:</h3>
                          <p>Here are some general tips for the Create PT:
                              <ul>
                                  <li><b>Reflection > Your code:</b> There is no difference to the grader if you create a simple math facts quiz game or if you were to remake FaceBook! You are only graded on your reflection. Because of that, it is important not to spend too much time on your code that you rush your reflection.</li>
                                  <li><b>Consider your decision about working with a partner carefully:</b> It depends on how you work with your partner. Will you get distracted a lot during class time? Will you and your partner both contribute to the code? When you work with a partner, you will probably be able to create something cooler as you have two brains working on the project, but you then have to follow all the Peer Collobaration rules. There are lots of rules with grey area in it, and it is best to work by yourself so you don't risk getting a 0 for plaigiarism.</li>
                                  <li><b>Don't be afraid to use the language taught in class:</b> This isn't something that you would think people would do, but it is. They either use languages they already knew before the class or they learn a new language for this. Don't do that! If you are comfortable with a different language already, then go for it. But don't waste your time learning a new language. The grader will not be impressed if you are using something separate from your classmates and will not affect your score at all.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </p>
                        </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 order-lg-1">
                        <div class="p-5">
                            <center><h2>Explore PT:</h2></center>
                          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                          <p>Your task is to explore a computing innovation and write a reflection that has:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>a computational artifact,</li>
                                  <li>effects of the innovation (beneficial, harmful, to society, economy, and culture),</li>
                                  <li>describe how the innovation uses data,</li>
                                  <li>and lastly data privacy/storage concern or a security concern related to the innovation.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </p>
    
                          <h3>Tips:</h3>
                          <p>Here are some general tips for the Explore PT:
                              <ul>
                                  <li><b>Don't spend too much time on the Computational Artifact:</b> It's only worth 1 point! The artifact just needs to identify the computing innovation and show a representation of its purpose, function or effect. A person who makes a really proffesional video on self driving cars that took him 5 hours to make will get the same amount of points as someone who took less than 1 hour to make an image that fits the requirements. One thing that is beneficial is stating purpose, effect, and function to make sure you get the point.</li>
                                  <li><b>Make sure to choose a computing innovation:</b> This may not sound like a big deal but if you choose something that isn't a computing innovation, you automatically lose 6 points out of 8. You can check with your teacher if they allow you to, but the best option is to choose an obvious innovation like Self Driving Cars. The graders will not give you any extra points by choosing a harder or not well-known computing innovation.</li>
                                  <li><b>Data collection devices isn't data:</b> This is something that many people lose points on. When you are describing a type of data that the innovation uses and consumed, you cannot just say a data collection device like sensors. Make sure to be specific in the type of data the computing innovation uses.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </p>
